# On what I did  by myself:
- Initially I did a very obtuse and complex way that actually solved the problem correctly!
- I spent A LOT of time not realizing I had an input reading issue. The way I read the input initially was very bad and depended on the input having a specific type, which was different for the last item
- besides that, taking a pen and paper made the problem much easier than trying to think with excalidraw, sadly.
- the idea of solving by multiplying the cost to see if it would become integer was plainly logically wrong and I didnt even realize =(
- solution used: plain old algebra, ceil(A)!=A to detect if double is an int.

- proh14 readFile() function is a masterclass on simplicity: he reads 3 lines from the file, puts on the equations, advance one char (next line) and that is it.
