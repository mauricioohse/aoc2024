# On what I did by myself:
- had big trouble with using an array as matrix =(
- made mistake on index validation, since in C the "arr_size" is not a valid index (it only goes from 0 to size-1)
- made a very clean way to get the input: just read char by char, put on the array, since it is a square matrix just get the size by sqrt() of the array size.
- initially had done a big map to save all data of the visited peaks (100x100x500 bytes). was not needed to keep all of them
- had to write two functions to print array. maybe it would be easier to use dynamic array that are more generic.
